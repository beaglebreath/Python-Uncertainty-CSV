This script is a Python function called `update_uncertainty`, which connects to a database using the `pyodbc` module and updates measurement uncertainties for calibration results based on an input ID number. Here’s a step-by-step synopsis:

1. **Establish Database Connection**: Connect to the database using `pyodbc.connect` with a specified DSN, UID, and password.

2. **Retrieve MTAG from Inventory**:
    - Query the `mt.inventory` table to get the `MTAG` for the given `id_num`.
    - If the `MTAG` is found, proceed; otherwise, print an error message.

3. **Retrieve CTAG from Calibration**:
    - Query the `mt.Calibration` table to get the `CTAG` for the retrieved `MTAG` where `C2339 = 1`.
    - If the `CTAG` is found, proceed; otherwise, print an error message.

4. **Retrieve CalResults for CTAG**:
    - Query the `mt.CalResults` table to get all rows for the `CTAG`, ordered by `C2504`.
    - If rows are found, proceed; otherwise, print an error message.

5. **Process New Uncertainty Value**:
    - If the new uncertainty value is a comma-separated list, split it into individual values.
    - If it’s a single value, repeat it for all rows.
    - If the list of uncertainties is shorter than the number of rows, pad the list with the last value.

6. **Update CalResults with New Uncertainty**:
    - Loop through each row in `calresults_rows` and update the `MeasUncertainty` field with the corresponding value from the `uncertainties` list.
    - Print the executed SQL statements for debugging.

7. **Commit Changes**:
    - Commit the updates to the database.
    - Print a success message.

8. **Handle Exceptions**:
    - Catch and print any errors that occur during the process.

9. **Close Connection**:
    - Ensure the database cursor and connection are closed in the `finally` block.

10. **Prompt for User Input**:
    - Prompt the user to enter an ID number and the new measurement uncertainty value (or CSV list).
    - Call the `update_uncertainty` function with the provided input.

This script is designed to automate the updating of measurement uncertainties in the calibration results based on user input, ensuring that each relevant record is updated with the correct uncertainty value.
